// Number of Values (without .Length)
// Without using the .length property that is present on all arrays, determine and return the number of values in the given array. If we were to do this on a numerical array, we might check to see whether the element at a certain numerical index was undefined. Unfortunately, we can’t do that here because the keys don’t have any sort of predictable order or first value.

// So, for object { band: "Travis Shredd & the Good Ol’ Homeboys", style: "Country/Metal/Rap", album: "668: The Neighbor of the Beast" }, you should return the value 3, because there are three keys in this object: band, style, and album.

function num_ofvalues(assocArr) {
    var count = 0;
    for (key in assocArr) {
      count++;
    }
    return count;
  }
  
  var arr1 = {band: "Travis Shredd & the Good Ol’ Homeboys", style: "Country/Metal/Rap", album: "668: The Neighbor of the Beast"};
  console.log(num_ofvalues(arr1));

//   output: 3
